❌ FAILS for VIEWER → ✅ WORKS for ADMIN
---

1️⃣ Customer PII leakage
❌ Viewer Question

### “Show customer emails and phone numbers from India”

Generated SQL (BLOCKED)
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'India'
❌ Why viewer fails

email, phone are not in viewer’s allowed columns

PII violation

✅ Admin Result
customer_id | first_name | last_name | email              | phone
---------------------------------------------------------------
1021        | Raj        | Sharma    | raj@gmail.com      | 9876543210
1187        | Anita      | Verma     | anita@yahoo.com    | 9123456789
2️⃣ Profit / cost analysis
❌ Viewer Question

### “Which products generate the highest profit?”

Generated SQL (BLOCKED)
SELECT product_name,
       SUM((unit_price - cost) * quantity) AS profit
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY profit DESC
❌ Why viewer fails

cost column is not allowed

Profit is explicitly an admin-only metric

✅ Admin Result
product_name     | profit
-----------------|--------
MacBook Pro      | 4,250,000
iPhone 15        | 3,980,000
Samsung TV       | 2,110,000
